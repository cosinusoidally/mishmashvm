This is the beginnings of an alternative bootstrap method that avoids the need
for the Emscripten compiled version of tcc. This alt method does not yet work.

Rough plan (all the below must be made to run on Linux and win32):

stage0-posix gets us from 2 hex seeds all the way up to a primitive c compiler

either:
- use gnu mes method from live-bootstrap to take us from M2-Planet to
  tcc-0.9.26
- cut down tcc-0.9.26 to the point where it can build with M2-Planet. This
  will be a big job. The benefit of doing this is to speed up the bootstrap
  process

tcc-0.9.26 from live-bootstrap

tcc-0.9.27 plus live-bootstrap patches

tcc-0.9.27 (mishmashvm version)

https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap contains code that can be used to
build tcc-0.9.26 and tcc-0.9.27

Note I will also need a libc. Not decided on this one yet. Some potential
options are:

- bring in musl from live-bootstrap
- JS polyfill implementation

Detailed plan:
