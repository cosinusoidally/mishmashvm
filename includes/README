These are the includes required by tcc. In usr/include are the glibc headers,
SDL-1.2 headers and the Linux headers from i386 Ubuntu 18.04. In tmp/tcc
are the headers from the tcc compiler.

These headers were generated as follows:

Grab the following from the Ubuntu official repo:

libc6-dev_2.27-3ubuntu1.2_i386.deb
linux-libc-dev_4.15.0-163.171_i386.deb
libsdl1.2-dev_1.2.15+dfsg2-0.1ubuntu0.1_i386.deb

For each of them run:

ar xv blah.deb
tar xvf data.tar...
rm data.tar...

Then pull out the usr/include directory

For the tcc includes you could probably just pull the relevant files out of
../tcc_src

Specifically:
../tcc_src/include/*
../tcc_src/tcclib.h
