Auxiliary stuff in this dir:

js_nodejs_wrapper.sh a wrapper around nodejs to bootstrap mmvm under nodejs
rename as "js" and put in your path to use.

bootstrap_with_gcc.sh an alternative first stage bootstrap via gcc. Currently
still relies on a js shell but uses gcc to create the initial tcc_boot3.o rather
than using the Emscripten generated version of tcc.
